Copy below text into a task and tick the items:

```
Some weeks before the release:
* [ ] Check if we should update the bundled sqlite3 (https://github.com/owncloud/client/tree/master/src/3rdparty/sqlite3)
* [ ] Check if we should update Sparkle on build machine (https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases)
* [ ] Ensure NSIS is up to date on the build machine
* [ ] Ensure up-to-date dependencies (e.g. [latest Qt version](http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-lib) is installed on the machine and picked up (cmake output)
* [ ] Ensure the crash reporter server is up
* [ ] Check crash reporter for bad crashes
* [ ] Ensure Windows Overlay DLLs are rebuilt
* [ ] Check nightly builds are up and running, that is Jenkins jobs ownCloud-client-linux, ownCloud-client-osx and ownCloud-client-win32 all green.
* [ ] Ensure Linux nightlies are built too for all distros https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/isv:ownCloud:community:nightly/owncloud-client
* [ ] Build branded clients through the scripting machine and smoke test one or two branded clients (especially with predefined url)
* [ ] Upload a nightly build of the windows version to virustotal.com
  * Contact AV vendors whom's engine reports a virus
* [ ] Documentation should be online before the release http://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/1.X/
* [ ] QA goes over https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/wiki/Testing-Scenarios
* [ ] Make sure to have `client/ChangeLog` updated
 * use `git log --format=oneline v<lastrelease>...master` if your memory fails you
* [ ] check if enterprise issues are fixed

For first Alpha/Beta of a Major or Minor release:
* [ ] branch off master to new version branch (e.g. master -> 2.1, when releasing 2.1)
* [ ] Adjust `VERSION.cmake` in master and count up (e.g. 2.2)
* [ ] Adjust translation jobs for [client](https://ci.owncloud.org/view/translation-sync/job/translation-sync-client/) and [NSIS](https://ci.owncloud.org/view/translation-sync/job/translation-sync-client-nsis/) to point to the release branch (e.g. 2.1).
* [ ] Make sure there is a job for the docs of the new master branch and the current release branch on rotor e.g. http://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/1.X/ exists

For all alphas, betas and RCs (Copy this section for each alpha/beta/rc):
* [ ] Add last updates to Changelog in the client source repository.
* [ ] Branch off a release branch called VERSION-rcX or VERSION-betaX  (without v, v is for tags)
* [ ] Edit ```VERSION.cmake``` to set the suffix to beta1, beta2 etc. Commit the result to the release branch only
* [ ] Create build for using owncloud-client-trigger (uncheck the "nightly build" checkbox, use the proper dropdown for version suffix) for theme 'ownCloud'
* [ ] Create build for using owncloud-client-trigger (uncheck the "nightly build" checkbox, use the proper dropdown for version suffix) for theme 'testpilotcloud'
* [ ] Only now download the last created source .tar.xz and sign it with gpg. Copy the signature into a new .asc file. (timing issue because currently 'testpilotcloud' re-creates the source .tar.xz)
* (no need to copy builds as they are already in testing directory or repository) (https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/wiki/Desktop-Signing-Knowledge)
* [ ] Mac: Perform smoke test (Install, make sure it does not explode, and check if all version indicators are correct)

* [ ] Create a pull request to the owncloud.org repository to update the install page (strings.php, page-desktop.php) and the changelog on owncloud.org. From now on download packages from the staging webserver.

15 minutes after after release:
* [ ] Test all advertised download links to have the expected version
* [ ] Check for build errors in OBS
* [ ] disable publishing in OBS to prevent that accidential rebuilds hit the end users.

A few days after the release (for final release)
* [ ] Review changes in the release branch, merge back into master
* [ ] check the crash reporter if auto update is a good idea or we need a new release
* [ ] Update the updater script ```clientupdater.php```
* [ ] Execute announced deprecations. Disable builds for deprecated platforms. Update accordingly: https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#desktop
* [ ] Increment version number in nightly builds. Special case: after the last release in a branch, jump forward to the 'next release branch'... That may mean, this is nightly is the same as edge then.
